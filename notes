Testing stuff:
  lein repl
  (load "core")
  (in-ns 'microblog.core)
  (def base (html-resource "templates/base.html"))
  ;Then I can do (select base <selector>) to test out selectors

push updates:
  use a nodejs server to broadcast updates
    use a net module connection to connect with regular socket from clojure
    use socket.io to connect to web clients, and to send out broadcasts

    client on clojure app does update
      clojure app sends update through socket to node.js server
      node.js server broadcasts updates through socket.io
